=== Examples

.PlantUML to LutaML UML
[example]
====

Given the following PlantUML PUML file `example.puml`:

[source,plantuml]
----
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
@enduml
----

Running the command:

```

diagram plantuml-simple.puml {
  association {
    owner Alice
    member Request
    member_type direct
  }
  association {
    owner Bob
    member Response
    member_type direct
  }
}

.LutaML YAML to LutaML UML
[example]
====

Given the following LutaML YAML file `Address.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Address
modelType: class
relations:
  - target: AddressComponent
    relationship:
      source:
        type: aggregation
        attributes:
          address:
            cardinality:
              min: 1
              max: "*"
      target:
        type: direct
        attributes:

              max: "*"
    action:
      verb: comprises
      direction: target
----

Running the command:

```
lutaml-yaml2uml Address.yml
```

The following results will be produced:

[source,lutaml]
----
diagram Address {
  title ''
